# Introduction To Python
## Researchers' Toolkit Series


This repository contains materials for use in the Researchers' Toolkit series
Python workshop.

Note that in the scripts I followed the convention from "Learn Python the Hard
Way" where the scripts do not have an initial "hashbang" line (the traditional
Unix way of telling the shell which interpreter to use to run a program). This
just means that the scripts must be executed at a command prompt with the
`python` command, e.g.

    python path/to/script.py

Which obviously implies that if students are downloading them as a zip file,
they need to `cd` to wherever they unzip the file contents.

Also! All scripts assume Python 3 -- `print` is now a function, not a statement.
And all division is now floating point division.
