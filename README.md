## Where To Go From Here: Links

### Online Classes

[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) -
A free interactive online course designed for people without programming experience.  Allows for experimentation, and reinforces lessons with quizzes and projects.  Highly recommended.

[Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) -
This online Intro to Python for Data Science class is available for free if you register with Data Camp.  I haven’t taken this course myself, however our group uses Data Camp for our R class and this course is highly regarded.


### Online Books

[Non-Programmer’s Tutorial for Python 3](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Non-Programmer%27s_Tutorial_for_Python_3/Hello,_World) -  Written in a style that doesn’t assume programming experience.

[Python Programming](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Overview) - Assumes prior programming experience.

### Helpful Websites
[Stack overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) lets you search on programming questions and read up-voted answers.  Be aware that you may be reading old answers that do not apply to your version of python.


## Notes on the Python Scripts (from Matthew)

Note that in the scripts I followed the convention from "Learn Python the Hard
Way" where the scripts do not have an initial "hashbang" line (the traditional
Unix way of telling the shell which interpreter to use to run a program). This
just means that the scripts must be executed at a command prompt with the
`python` command, e.g.

    python path/to/script.py

Which obviously implies that if students are downloading them as a zip file,
they need to `cd` to wherever they unzip the file contents.

Also! All scripts assume Python 3 -- `print` is now a function, not a statement.
And all division is now floating point division.
