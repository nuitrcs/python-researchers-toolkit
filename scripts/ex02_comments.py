# This is a "comment".

# Comments begin with a # character.

# Python will ignore any line that begins with #.

print("Python won't ignore this line.")

# Comments do not have to be an entire line.

print("This line has a comment at the end of it.") # This is another comment.

# Normally comments are a whole line to themselves though. They are easier to
# read that way.

# We use comments to leave notes for the people who will be reading our code.

# Comments can also be used to "disable" or "hide" a line of code:
# print("Python will ignore this line")

# Try removing the # character from the previous line, then run the script again
# and see what happens.
